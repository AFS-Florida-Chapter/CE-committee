A number of questions came in through that chanel.\nAttendance was ~ 20 students, not back considering size of the meeting.\nStudent-mentor lunch was pretty easy, we’ll plan to do that again this year.\n\nWe reviewed CE committee running list of workshop ideas. Sara suggested that the runner-up topic from two years ago (structured decision making) was relevant to the meeting symposium topic:\n\n“The Circle of Life of Fisheries Projects: Best Practices for Project Development, Management, Evaluation and Making Improvements for the Next Round”\n\nGroup consensus to try to organize a structured decision making workshop.\nNick will reach out to Conor McGowan through Kim Bonvechio, or during in-person meeting next week.\nNo future meeting currently scheduled, we’ll see what Conor says and decide on future meeting needs via email.\n\nTo Do:\n\nAdd student-mentor lunch question to Regfox meeting registration form. Look into feasibility of adding a conditional follow-up question that prompts for a categorical match preference. - Sara\nGet a list of possible maatch categories for student-mentor lunch from an existing source. -Allison\nAsk Conor McGowan if he would be interested in leading a Structured Decision Making Workshop at the 2025 FL AFS annual meeting. - Nick\nReach out to Brigette to let her know that we’d like to submit the workshop announcement in the next Shellcracker (Winter 2025) -Jason"

Budget for 45-60 minutes of moderated panelist discussion and 30-45 minutes of audience Q&A.\nMay not be an issue if Career Panel is the last event on the schedule … Q&A can go for as long as folks are interested… but that could also contribute to lower participation if folks are wanting to get on the road.\n\n\nStudent-Mentor lunch\n\ncurrently there are 27 mentors and 22 students signed up for the event.\n\ncan do 1-1 assignment, extra mentors can be assigned any students that register for meeting on site.\nbriefly discussed whether we do 3 mentor-3 student table arrangement, but decided the 1v1 approach is best. As minimal structure as possible will be best. No seating assignments. No ice breakers. This may foster more organic interactions.\nHow do we assign students to mentors? Random? Strategic?\n\nstrategic may be tough…\nAgreed to random-ish approach. Random, but avoid affiliation matches as much as possible.\n\n\nHow many registered students signed up for the event?\n\nCurrently there are ~45 students register, and ~ 22 students signed up for event…. so about half\nDo we want to email a reminder to to all registered students and ask if they would like to be added?\n\nHow long is lunch? 1 hour? is this long enough?\n\nLast year the lines for food were very long. If student-mentor pairs get stuck in this line it could limit the amount of time they have to chat… or they could be forced to chat while standing in line. Can we arrange for student-mentors to access the food line ahead of other participants? Ask EXCOM\nLunch on Wednesday? – Earlier the better, but Tuesday people might still be arriving. This really the only time slot that works well.

She also reached out to Marcus Beck and he provided a few questions to add to the survey. Allison will revise draft and distribute to membership in the next week or so. CE committee, please review draft and send Allison any revisions ASAP.\nRachel is still working on website update ideas for the committee page. We will table this discussion for future meeting.\nOpen forum for discussing ideas for a virtual summer workshop (late Aug - early Sep)\n\nRachel suggested that a lot of CE workshops are geared towards early career professionals, how can we pick topics that might be of more interest to mid-late career professionals as well?\n\nhow to build mentor-mentee relationships\nretirement planning\ntime management\n\nleadership development\n\nDiscussed our previous attempt to recruit Steve McMillan to give an in person seminar at the 2022 chapter meeting. Plans fell through and we pivoted, but might be worth revisiting. Maybe not the best option for a virtual meeting because it would be nice to give people opportunity to meet and speak with Steve in person.\nAlternatively, Nick or Dan might be able to coordinate with NRDI instructors to host a workshop on leadership topics\n\nCareer fair/panel oriented towards students\nscience communication\n\ntechnical writing\nhow to talk to the public\nconflict management\n\n\nGroup discussion began to gravitate around the career panel idea.\n\nbetter in person or virtual?\n\nvirtual option might allow us to recruit panelists, who might not typically be willing/able to travel to in-person meeting, but miss out on networking opportunities and face-to-face interaction\nin-person - gives students a more personal experience/networking opportunites/more engaging, but maybe more difficult to recruit panelists and fitting a panel in meeting agenda could be tough logistically\n\nDan suggested we do both - virtual in the fall and then carving out a spot in the chapter meeting agenda for an in-person career fair event, where organizations would have table space set up during an open session. Group expressed general agreement with this approach.\nNeed to pitch the idea of having a career panel at the next chapter meeting to EXCOM. It will need to be accounted for in the meeting agenda.\n\nWhat do we need to do to organize virtual panel for the fall?\n\nIdentify organizations and panelists to contact – shared google doc would be a great place to store this information\nPlatform? - Microsoft teams is convenient for FWC and other folks employed at large organizations, but zoom might more familiar to students than teams, also may be able to avoid headaches with out-of-network attendees using zoom. Allison has zoom account through Florida Southern that can accommodate ~ 100 attendees. Maybe Angela has access to zoom account through UF with even greater capability?\nWhen should we plan to host the seminar?\n\nlate summer, before class starts may be good for grad students, but undergrads usually MIA\nif we host it during the school year, it would give us an opportunity to announce the panel through professors\nAllison suggested doing it within the first month of the semester before workload picks up for both students and professors.\nClasses start Aug 23rd for many - maybe we try to target mid September. Might be good to see if there is a time that best for the greatest number of panelists before setting final date.\n\n\nLets start compiling a list of potential panelists and format ideas. Everyone please take some time before the next meeting to add ideas and thoughts to google doc that Jason will share.\nMeet again in 1 month to discuss progress, and next steps.\n\nTo Do:\n\nFinalize survey draft and distribute to membership - Allison\nnew webpage mock-up - Rachel\nfigure out a good way to implement repository for committe documents- Jason\nschedule July meeting - Jason\nCreate a shared google doc for organizing virtual job panel - Jason\nContribute ideas to shared document - All\n\nNext Meeting:\nTBD - late July, keep an eye out for meeting schedule poll\nTentative Agenda:\n\nVirtual career panel planning\n\nreview panelist ideas and discuss any communications with potential panelists\ndiscuss format ideas\nwho will moderate?\nhow/where do we advertise?"

Attendance was ~20-25. This was higher slightly higher than attendance at the critical thinking workhop presented at the 2022 Chapter Meeting. Mostly positive reviews of the workshop. We had about ~60-70 people indicate that they planned to attend the workshop on the meeting registration form, in light of this, attendance was somewhat disappointing. Did the timing of the workshop (post-meeting) hamper attendance or was topic less interesting to membership? - Might be good time to send out a membership survey.\nRachel suggested updating website to include a continuing ed page that list other opportunities for professional development in addition to the workshops the committee has organized. More a one-stop shop for all kinds of resources related to continuing education.\nThe committee has a lot of resources we’ve accumlated: meeting notes, idea lists, survey templates, and results. It would be good to establish a central repository (e.g. google drive, website page, etc) for these resources so they are easier to find, and pass on to new committee members in the future.\nLet’s plan to meet Late June-Early July to discuss summer/fall workshop ideas.\n\nTo Do:\n\nput together membership survey - Allison\nnew webpage mockup - Rachel\nfigure out a good way to implement repository - Jason\nsend out meeting invite - Jason"
