Students? Students and early career professionals?\nwhat topics should panel cover?\n\nIdentify Student-Mentor lunch planning needs\n\nDo we need to recruit more mentors?\nProvide ice-breakers or guidance to mentors?\nRandom assignment of students to mentors or strategic?\nHow do we identify/organize tables during the event if room will also be hosting lunch for non-participants?\nLunch on Wednesday?\n\nDiscuss committee update for business meeting\n\nMeeting Objective(s):\n\nFinalize career panel and student-mentor lunch details for the upcoming annual meeting\n\nAttendees:\n\n\n\nJason O’Connor\nRachel Liebman\n\n\n\n\nKerry Walia-Flaherty\nBridgette Froeschke\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nCareer Panel\n\nAll six of our career panelists are confirmed and registered\nJoy Hazell (UF - NRLI) has agreed to moderate the event.\n\nneed to follow up with Joy to discuss event specifics – maybe can hammer out via e-mail – schedule meeting if necessary\n\nHow do we encourage participation?\n\nThere are currently about 55-60 folks who indicated on registration that they would be interested in attending the CE event… Hard to put a lot of stock in this since there were no specific details about the event provided.\nCreate an advertisement poster.\n\nadd to website\nemail out to registered students\nemail out to membership\ncontact professors to ask that they encourage their students to participate\n\n\nDiscussed some ideas about what might be covered/included in the career panel.\n\nWho is intended audience?\n\nStudents and early career professionals – a lot of FWC participants with 5 or fewer years post-bachelors might benefit\n\nWhat do we want panelists to discuss?\n\nPath to current career\nWhat do day-to-day responsibilities entail\nHow have your career goals evolved?\nTips for getting hired into respective organization\n\nInteractive event: have audience share the skills/attributes that they think are important and have panelists rank them … might could be done through interactive platform like mentimeter\nInteractive event: host a mentimeter survey that is displayed via QR code during session breaks to get meeting participant data — display and discuss results during career panel.\n\nWhat is one skill or class that best prepared you for your current position?\n\n\n\n\nNeed to leave room for questions\n\nHow long should we plan for the event to last? – A minimum of 1.5 hours. Budget for 45-60 minutes of moderated panelist discussion and 30-45 minutes of audience Q&A.\nMay not be an issue if Career Panel is the last event on the schedule … Q&A can go for as long as folks are interested… but that could also contribute to lower participation if folks are wanting to get on the road.\n\n\nStudent-Mentor lunch\n\ncurrently there are 27 mentors and 22 students signed up for the event.\n\ncan do 1-1 assignment, extra mentors can be assigned any students that register for meeting on site.\nbriefly discussed whether we do 3 mentor-3 student table arrangement, but decided the 1v1 approach is best. As minimal structure as possible will be best. No seating assignments. No ice breakers. This may foster more organic interactions.\nHow do we assign students to mentors? Random? Strategic?\n\nstrategic may be tough…\nAgreed to random-ish approach. Random, but avoid affiliation matches as much as possible.\n\n\nHow many registered students signed up for the event?\n\nCurrently there are ~45 students register, and ~ 22 students signed up for event…. so about half\nDo we want to email a reminder to to all registered students and ask if they would like to be added?\n\nHow long is lunch? 1 hour? is this long enough?\n\nLast year the lines for food were very long. If student-mentor pairs get stuck in this line it could limit the amount of time they have to chat… or they could be forced to chat while standing in line. Can we arrange for student-mentors to access the food line ahead of other participants? Ask EXCOM\nLunch on Wednesday? – Earlier the better, but Tuesday people might still be arriving. This really the only time slot that works well. No change.\n\n\nCommittee Business Meeting Update\n\nAcknowledge committee members that are stepping down\n\nDan Nelson\nCarissa Gervassi\nMichelle Shaffer\n\nCall for new committee members\n\nNeed to develop a committee mission statement and define annual commitment – may have some of this stuff already – check sharedrive files\nmaybe put up a committee sign-up sheet at the meeting?\nif no volunteers maybe we should consider recruiting 1-2 new members… could use some current students\n\n\n\nTo Do:\n\nReach out to Joy to discuss event details (email chain or meeting) - Nick\nAsk EXCOM about student-mentor lunch logistics & budgeting for 1.5hr career panel - Jason\nCreate event flyer for career panel that can be distributed via email list serve and hosted on website - Kerry\nCreate a mentimeter survey mock-up - Kerry"

She also reached out to Marcus Beck and he provided a few questions to add to the survey. Allison will revise draft and distribute to membership in the next week or so. CE committee, please review draft and send Allison any revisions ASAP.\nRachel is still working on website update ideas for the committee page. We will table this discussion for future meeting.\nOpen forum for discussing ideas for a virtual summer workshop (late Aug - early Sep)\n\nRachel suggested that a lot of CE workshops are geared towards early career professionals, how can we pick topics that might be of more interest to mid-late career professionals as well?\n\nhow to build mentor-mentee relationships\nretirement planning\ntime management\n\nleadership development\n\nDiscussed our previous attempt to recruit Steve McMillan to give an in person seminar at the 2022 chapter meeting. Plans fell through and we pivoted, but might be worth revisiting. Maybe not the best option for a virtual meeting because it would be nice to give people opportunity to meet and speak with Steve in person.\nAlternatively, Nick or Dan might be able to coordinate with NRDI instructors to host a workshop on leadership topics\n\nCareer fair/panel oriented towards students\nscience communication\n\ntechnical writing\nhow to talk to the public\nconflict management\n\n\nGroup discussion began to gravitate around the career panel idea.\n\nbetter in person or virtual?\n\nvirtual option might allow us to recruit panelists, who might not typically be willing/able to travel to in-person meeting, but miss out on networking opportunities and face-to-face interaction\nin-person - gives students a more personal experience/networking opportunites/more engaging, but maybe more difficult to recruit panelists and fitting a panel in meeting agenda could be tough logistically\n\nDan suggested we do both - virtual in the fall and then carving out a spot in the chapter meeting agenda for an in-person career fair event, where organizations would have table space set up during an open session. Group expressed general agreement with this approach.\nNeed to pitch the idea of having a career panel at the next chapter meeting to EXCOM. It will need to be accounted for in the meeting agenda.\n\nWhat do we need to do to organize virtual panel for the fall?\n\nIdentify organizations and panelists to contact – shared google doc would be a great place to store this information\nPlatform? - Microsoft teams is convenient for FWC and other folks employed at large organizations, but zoom might more familiar to students than teams, also may be able to avoid headaches with out-of-network attendees using zoom. Allison has zoom account through Florida Southern that can accommodate ~ 100 attendees. Maybe Angela has access to zoom account through UF with even greater capability?\nWhen should we plan to host the seminar?\n\nlate summer, before class starts may be good for grad students, but undergrads usually MIA\nif we host it during the school year, it would give us an opportunity to announce the panel through professors\nAllison suggested doing it within the first month of the semester before workload picks up for both students and professors.\nClasses start Aug 23rd for many - maybe we try to target mid September. Might be good to see if there is a time that best for the greatest number of panelists before setting final date.\n\n\nLets start compiling a list of potential panelists and format ideas. Everyone please take some time before the next meeting to add ideas and thoughts to google doc that Jason will share.\nMeet again in 1 month to discuss progress, and next steps.\n\nTo Do:\n\nFinalize survey draft and distribute to membership - Allison\nnew webpage mock-up - Rachel\nfigure out a good way to implement repository for committe documents- Jason\nschedule July meeting - Jason\nCreate a shared google doc for organizing virtual job panel - Jason\nContribute ideas to shared document - All\n\nNext Meeting:\nTBD - late July, keep an eye out for meeting schedule poll\nTentative Agenda:\n\nVirtual career panel planning\n\nreview panelist ideas and discuss any communications with potential panelists\ndiscuss format ideas\nwho will moderate?\nhow/where do we advertise?"

Attendance was ~20-25. This was higher slightly higher than attendance at the critical thinking workhop presented at the 2022 Chapter Meeting. Mostly positive reviews of the workshop. We had about ~60-70 people indicate that they planned to attend the workshop on the meeting registration form, in light of this, attendance was somewhat disappointing. Did the timing of the workshop (post-meeting) hamper attendance or was topic less interesting to membership? - Might be good time to send out a membership survey.\nRachel suggested updating website to include a continuing ed page that list other opportunities for professional development in addition to the workshops the committee has organized. More a one-stop shop for all kinds of resources related to continuing education.\nThe committee has a lot of resources we’ve accumlated: meeting notes, idea lists, survey templates, and results. It would be good to establish a central repository (e.g. google drive, website page, etc) for these resources so they are easier to find, and pass on to new committee members in the future.\nLet’s plan to meet Late June-Early July to discuss summer/fall workshop ideas.\n\nTo Do:\n\nput together membership survey - Allison\nnew webpage mockup - Rachel\nfigure out a good way to implement repository - Jason\nsend out meeting invite - Jason"
